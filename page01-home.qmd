## About

I am an undergraduate at the Singapore Institute of Technology studying Applied Artificial Intelligence. 

Before this, I graduated from Nanyang Polytechnic with a Diploma in Game Development and Technology, which has equipped me with programming skills in the context of game development. Although I was trained primarily in `C++`, I have experience in other programming languages like `C#`, `Java`, `Python`, and `R`. Additionally, I have experience using the `Unity` game engine.

Throughout my Diploma studies, I have worked on many projects, including a **top-down shooter**(for which I wrote all the scripts) and a **Virtual Reality** horror game (I handled input logic as well as some gameplay scripts), both of which were built in `Unity`.
