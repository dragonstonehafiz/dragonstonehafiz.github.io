# Game Projects

The projects showcased here were all made during my time at Nanyang Polytechnic. The first three projects, *Electronica*, *LOCUS*, and *The Last Survivor*, were written in `C#` on the `Unity Game Engine`. The last two projects, *AI Pathfinding Game* and *A Simple Physics Game*, were made as part of some assignments for two the AI and Physics modules respectively. These games were written in `C++` on a custom engine provided by the school.


## Electronica (FYP 2)


### Background:

A top down shooter inspired by Geometry Wars. Built on the `Unity Game Engine`, all the code for this game was written by me over the course of three months. This was a solo project, and the final thing I worked on before graduating from Nanyang Polytechnic.


### What I did: 

- **5 unique enemies** with different movement patterns

- **4 unique bosses** with different gameplay mechanics

- **2 different game modes**, Classic and Onslaught. In Classic, the game is round based with boss rounds occurring every 4 rounds. In Onslaught, enemies spawn constantly with increasing intensity.

- **User Interface**: A particular point of pride for me was animating the health bars for both players and bosses.

## LOCUS (FYP 1)


### Background:

This was a Visual Reality (**VR**) game that I worked on with other students, including artists and even some exchange students. The game was built on the `Unity Game Engine` and was designed to be played on the `HTC Vive`. The project was actually a horror-puzzle game that was started by another group of students just a few months prior.


### What I did:

- **User Input** with the HTC Vive controllers

- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Things like puzzles, scares, and the game's progression
